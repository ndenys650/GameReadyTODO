    <p>"Game Ready" was made in three days time with the wonderful help and guidance of Danny Connell between both his Youtube video and course from Skillshare.com. Working through Danny's video lectures brought me a better understanding of how to implement and configure Vue components with the Vuetify framework.</p>

    <p class="font-weight-bold">Major Features of this Application include:</p>
    <p>Vue.js Parent-Child components handled by Vue-Router and a Vuex Store</p>
    <p>Vuetify to control Mobile First Responsiveness and Material Design UI/UX</p>
    <p>Localbase for a locally stored Database to contain your own tasks in modern browsers</p>
    <p><i>SASS</i> compiled CSS</p>
    <p>Committed to Git then built and deployed with Netlify</p>
